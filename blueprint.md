# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This is a simple, visually appealing web application that allows users to generate random lottery numbers. It is built with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging Web Components for a modular structure.

## Style, Design, and Features

*   **Layout:** A centered, card-like interface.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant and energetic color scheme with gradients and shadows to create depth.
*   **Typography:** Clear, legible fonts with good hierarchy.
*   **Interactivity:** A "Generate Numbers" button with a glowing effect on hover. The generated numbers will be displayed in styled individual elements.
*   **Web Component:** A `<lotto-ball>` custom element is used to display each generated number, encapsulating its style and behavior.
*   **Background:** A subtle noise texture on the background for a premium feel.

## Current Plan

1.  **Update `index.html`:** Set up the basic structure for the lottery number generator, including a title, a container for the numbers, and a generation button.
2.  **Update `style.css`:** Apply modern styling to the elements, including a responsive layout, custom fonts, color variables, and interactive effects.
3.  **Update `main.js`:** Implement the lottery number generation logic and create a custom element (`<lotto-ball>`) to display the numbers in a visually appealing way.
